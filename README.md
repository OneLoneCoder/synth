# synth

This code is used in the Code-It-Yourself sound synthesizer videos on the onelonecoder.com blog

UPDATE : The original code didn't work with GCC, so this code has been updated to work with GCC / MinGWx64, and still should be compatible with Visual Studio. It works under codeblocks as well.
